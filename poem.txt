Difficult because we think that happiness is found
Only in the places where wealth and fame abound.
And so we go on searching in places of pleasure 
seeking recognition and monetary treasure,
Unaware that happiness is just a state of mind
within the reach of everyone who takes time to be kind,
For in making others happy we will be happy, too.
For the happiness you give away returns to shine on you.
